These examples calculate visibility metrics for OSM and GeoPandas sources of building footprints data.

> Requires `cityseer` version 4.21.4 or later.

## Visibility from OSM data

Calculate visibility metrics for OSM from bounding box coordinates.

[Notebook](vis_osm.ipynb)

## Visibility from geopandas data

Calculate visibility metrics from a `geopandas` `GeoDataFrame`.

[Notebook](vis_gpd.ipynb)

## Visibility from raster data

Calculate visibility metrics from a raster file, such as a GeoTIFF. This permits blending building footprints with DEM data to take elevation into account.
