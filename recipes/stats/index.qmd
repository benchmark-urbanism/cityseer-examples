The following two examples use the [`layers.compute_stats`](https://cityseer.benchmarkurbanism.com/metrics/layers#compute-stats) method to compute statistics such as `min`, `max`, `mean`, and `var`. In general, the same network pre-processing steps can be followed as shown for these network preparation steps or for the network centrality steps. A data set is their necessary for identifying the locations of different land uses and it is the impossible to compete accessibilities over the network using the `layers.compute_stats` method.

This method requires:

- A `geopandas` `GeoDataFrame` parameter containing landuse data;
- A `stats_column_labels` identifying the corresponding numeric columns for which to compute statistics;
