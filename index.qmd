This cookbook contains a collection of recipes to illustrate typical usage scenarios for `cityseer`.

The recipes build on each other, so if you are wondering why or how to do something, you may find the answers in another (typically preceding) recipe.

Please open an issue to request the addition of further examples for a given use-case.

## Datasets

The datasets used from the recipes are available on the [datasets](../data/datasets.qmd) page, where you can also find information on the sources.

## Installation

To install `cityseer`, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install --upgrade cityseer
```

Or, from a notebook:

```python
!pip install --upgrade cityseer
```

The examples in this cookbook also use packages such as `geopandas`, `networkx`, and `matplotlib`. You can install them using the same method.

## Recipes

### Network Preparation

`cityseer` uses `networkx` [`MultiGraphs`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/classes/multigraph.html) to represent pedestrian networks. In doing so, it embeds spatial information in the graph nodes and edges so that it can accurately manipulate the graphs and calculate derivative metrics.

See the [Network Preparation](./recipes/networks/index.qmd) page for examples of how to create a `cityseer` compatible `networkx` graph from:

- OSM data using bounding boxes, radii around points, or from a custom boundary file;
- `geopandas` data including the use of `geopandas` to open and import files such as geopackages and shapefiles;
- Imports from `momepy` and `osmnx`;
- Automatic and manual network simplification;
- Casting primal networks to dual representations to model and visualise metrics using streets instead of intersections.

### Metrics

`cityseer` converts the network into a `rust` data structure prior to computing derivative metrics. This is done to improve performance so that it can be used on large networks.

This is done using [`network_structure_from_nx`](https://cityseer.benchmarkurbanism.com/tools/io#network-structure-from-nx) function which is available in the `cityseer` `io` module. Once you've prepared the nodes `GeoDataFrame` and the `NetworkStructure` from the `network_structure_from_nx` function, you can use it over and over again to calculate a variety of metrics.
This function returns three objects:

- A nodes `GeoDataFrame` with the graph's nodes. This is used for saving the outputs of calculations, and makes it easy to export the outputs of calculations to files that can be used from QGIS or other GIS software and workflows.
- An edges `GeoDataFrame` with the graph's edges, including information that has been generated for the graph's edges such as metric and angular distances, entry and exit angles, and the overall bearing of the edge.
- A `cityseer` `NetworkStructure` object which is used by `cityseer` for calculating the measures.

Use of the dual representation is optional, but recommended. Keep in mind that if you've converted your `networkx` network into a dual representation, then the nodes `GeoDataFrame` will contain both the dual nodes (midpoints of streets) the primal edges. The primal edges will be set to the default geometry so that outputs can be visualised using the primal street geometries.

#### Centrality

See the [Network Centrality](./recipes/centrality/index.qmd) page for examples of how to efficiently calculate a variety of shortest metric and simplest angular centrality metrics.

#### Accessibility

See the [Accessibility](./recipes/accessibility/index.qmd) page for examples of how to efficiently calculate a variety of landuse accessibility and mixed-use metrics.

#### Statistical Measures

### Edge Rolloff

When calculating network or layer metrics, the network has to be buffered by a distance equal to the maximum distance threshold being considered by the algorithms. This prevents problematic results arising due to edge roll-off effects. For example, if running centrality and/or land-use analysis using distances of 500, 1000, 2000m, then the network must be buffered by 2000m. When using data layers, the data points should --- for the same reasons --- cover these buffered extents as well.

The `live=True` node attribute is used for identifying nodes falling within the original non-buffered graph extents as opposed to the `live=False` nodes that fall within the surrounding buffered area. The underlying shortest-path algorithms will have access to both `live=True` and `live=False` nodes (thus preventing edge rolloff), but derivative metrics are only tabulated for `live=True` nodes. This eliminates edge roll-off effects, reduces unnecessary computation, and cleanly identifies which nodes are or are not in the buffered roll-off area. If some other post-processing step will be used for filtering the nodes, or if boundary roll-off is not being considered, then use the default behaviour where all nodes automatically set to `live=True`.
