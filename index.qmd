## Datasets

The datasets used from the recipes are available on the [datasets](../data/datasets.qmd) page, where you can also find information on the sources.

## Python 101

If you are new to Python or computational notebooks, it is recommended to first start with the [Python 101](class/index.qmd) section.

## Recipes

If you already have some experience, or if you're feeling brave, you can dive straight into the [recipes section](recipes/index.qmd), which contains practical examples and use-case scenarios for `cityseer`.

## Installation

To install `cityseer`, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install --upgrade cityseer
```

Or, from a notebook:

```python
!pip install --upgrade cityseer
```

The examples in this cookbook also use packages such as `geopandas`, `networkx`, and `matplotlib`. You can install them using the same method.
