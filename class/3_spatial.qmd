title: Spatial (Shapely)
---

#### Basic Geometry

```python
from shapely.geometry import Point, Polygon

# Create a point
pt = Point(-3.7038, 40.4168)
print(pt)

# Create a polygon
poly = Polygon([(-3.70, 40.41), (-3.71, 40.41), (-3.71, 40.42), (-3.70, 40.42)])
print(poly)
```

#### Example: Distance and Buffer

```python
# Distance between two points
pt2 = Point(-3.70, 40.42)
print(pt.distance(pt2))

# Buffer (circle around a point)
buffer = pt.buffer(0.01)
print(buffer)
```

#### Example: Point in Polygon

```python
print(pt.within(poly))
```

#### Exercise 5.1:

- Create two points and calculate the distance between them.
- Create a polygon and check if a point is inside it.

#### Example: Intersecting Geometries

```python
poly2 = Polygon([(-3.705, 40.415), (-3.715, 40.415), (-3.715, 40.425), (-3.705, 40.425)])
print(poly.intersects(poly2))
```

#### Exercise 5.2:

- Create two polygons and check if they intersect.
- Create a buffer around a point and plot it using geopandas.

#### Challenge 5:

- Create a list of points and a polygon. Check which points are inside the polygon.
- Create buffers around several points and plot them all on a map.
