When working with spatial data in urban analysis, we often deal with many geographic features at once (like buildings, streets, or administrative boundaries). While you could process each feature individually, it's far more efficient to manage and analyse them together in a structured format.

For general data analysis in Python, the `pandas` library is the standard tool. Pandas provides the `DataFrame`, a powerful table-like structure where rows represent observations (e.g., individual buildings) and columns represent attributes (e.g., height, area, land use). This is conceptually similar to attribute tables in GIS software like QGIS or ArcGIS.

[**GeoPandas**](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/) extends pandas by adding first-class support for geographic data. It introduces the `GeoDataFrame`, which is essentially a pandas `DataFrame` with a special column that holds geometry objects (like points, lines, or polygons). This allows you to seamlessly combine tabular data analysis with spatial operations.

Key features of GeoPandas include:

- Storing geometric data alongside other attributes.
- Reading and writing various spatial file formats (Shapefile, GeoPackage, GeoJSON, etc.).
- Performing spatial operations (buffering, intersection, union, etc.).
- Handling Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS).
- Easy plotting of spatial data.

## From Scratch

While you'll often load spatial data directly from files, understanding how to create a `GeoDataFrame` manually is helpful. To create one, you typically need:

1. Tabular data (like a list of dictionaries or a pandas DataFrame).
2. Corresponding geometry objects.
3. A Coordinate Reference System (CRS) identifier.

Let's start with a simple example.

```{python}
import geopandas as gpd
from shapely.geometry import Point
```

First, let's define some tabular data as a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a city with its name and approximate coordinates (longitude, latitude).

```{python}
data = [
    {"city": "Madrid", "x": -3.7038, "y": 40.4168},
    {"city": "Barcelona", "x": 2.1734, "y": 41.3851},
    {"city": "Valencia", "x": -0.3774, "y": 39.4699}
]

data
```

Next, we need to create the corresponding geometry objects. Since these are coordinates, `Point` objects are appropriate. We can create a list of `Point` objects directly from our data.

```{python}
# Create Point geometries from the x and y columns
locations = []

for city in data:
    locations.append(Point(city["x"], city["y"]))

locations
```

Now we have the tabular data and the geometry. The final piece is the CRS. Since the coordinates are longitude and latitude, the appropriate CRS is WGS 84, which has the EPSG code 4326.

We can now create the `GeoDataFrame`:

```{python}
gdf_cities = gpd.GeoDataFrame(
    data,  # The tabular data
    geometry=locations,  # The Shapely geometry objects
    crs="EPSG:4326"  # Coordinate Reference System (WGS 84)
)

gdf_cities
```

Notice that GeoPandas automatically recognised the `geometry` list as the active geometry column. (You can also specify a different column name if needed.)

## Indexing

Like pandas DataFrames, GeoDataFrames have an index. By default, it's a range of integers. You can set a more meaningful index using one of the columns, such as the city name, using the `set_index()` method. This can make selecting data easier.

```{python}
gdf_cities = gdf_cities.set_index("city")

gdf_cities
```

You can access a row using its index. Pandas has a special indexing method called `loc[]` that allows you to access rows by their index label. This is particularly useful when you have set a meaningful index, like city names.

```{python}
gdf_cities.loc["Madrid"]
```

You can also pass in a column name. For example, to get the latitude of Barcelona:

```{python}
gdf_cities.loc['Barcelona', "y"]
```

To return all rows for a given column, you can use the `:` operator. For example, to get all the rows for the `y` column:

```{python}
gdf_cities.loc[:, "y"]
```

An extremely powerful feature of GeoDataFrames is the ability to filter rows based on their properties. For this you can create a boolean mask which can be used to mask-out the rows you are not interested in. For example, if you want to filter the cities to only include those with a latitude greater than 40, you can do this:

```{python}
# Create a boolean mask
mask = gdf_cities["y"] > 40

mask
```

This mask is a pandas Series of booleans, where `True` indicates that the condition is met (y > 40) and `False` otherwise. You can now use this mask to filter the rows in the original GeoDataFrame.

```{python}
# Use the mask to filter the rows
gdf_cities.loc[mask]
```

As you can see, only two rows are returned because the third city, Valencia, has a latitude of less than 40.

## Geospatial

GeoDataFrames have special properties related to their spatial nature.

For example, GeoPandas knows which column contains the spatial data. You can access it directly using the `.geometry` attribute. This returns a `GeoSeries`.

```{python}
gdf_cities.geometry
```

It also knows the CRS, which can be accessed using the `.crs` attribute.

```{python}
gdf_cities.crs
```

Conveniently, GeoPandas integrates with `matplotlib` for quick and easy plotting. Calling `.plot()` on a GeoDataFrame will render its geometries.

```{python}
gdf_cities.plot()
```

### Coordinate Transformations

GeoPandas makes CRS transformation straightforward with the `to_crs()` method. Make sure you use a projected coordinate reference system when doing detailed spatial analysis. Let's convert our cities GeoDataFrame to EPSG:3035, a projected equal-area CRS suitable for Europe (ETRS89-LAEA).

```{python}
gdf_cities_proj = gdf_cities.to_crs(3035)

gdf_cities_proj
```

Notice how the `x` and `y` columns no longer match the geometry, as the geometry is now in metres according to EPSG:3035. The `.crs` attribute reflects this change:

```{python}
gdf_cities_proj.crs
```

Plotting the transformed data shows the locations relative to the new projected coordinate system.

```{python}
gdf_cities_proj.plot()
```

### Spatial Operations

GeoPandas allows you to apply spatial operations directly to `GeoDataFrames` or `GeoSeries`. These operations work element-wise.

For example, to create a 100km buffer around each city:

```{python}
# The buffer distance is in the units of the CRS (metres for EPSG:3035)
gdf_cities_proj["geometry"] = gdf_cities_proj.geometry.buffer(100000)  # 100km buffer

gdf_cities_proj.plot()
```

Or, to calculate the distance from each feature in a GeoDataFrame to a single Shapely geometry object. Let's find the distance from each city buffer to a specific point (also defined in EPSG:3035 coordinates):

```{python}
# Define a point in the same CRS (EPSG:3035)
pt = Point(3300000, 2000000)

# Calculate distance from each geometry in the GeoSeries to the point
gdf_cities_proj.geometry.distance(pt)
```

### Creating and Updating Columns

It is very easy to create or update the values of a column in a data frame

For example, if we wanted to create a new column called easting and set it to the x coordinate of the geometry, we could do this:

```{python}
gdf_cities_proj['easting'] = gdf_cities_proj.geometry.centroid.x

gdf_cities_proj
```

Each row of geometry in the data frame is a shapely geometry so you can use conventional shapely syntax for accessing properties of a geometry such as the centroid or the centroids x coordinate.

If you change your mind and instead wanted to simply update the existing `x` and `y` columns, then you can reference these columns directly:

```{python}
gdf_cities_proj['x'] = gdf_cities_proj.geometry.centroid.x
gdf_cities_proj['y'] = gdf_cities_proj.geometry.centroid.y

gdf_cities_proj
```

Data frames have an extensive variety of useful methods however we will use the `drop` method to remove the column we no longer wish to keep:

```{python}
gdf_cities_proj = gdf_cities_proj.drop(columns=['easting'])

gdf_cities_proj
```

## Working with Data

### Reading Data

GeoPandas can read various spatial data formats, including Shapefiles, GeoPackages, and GeoJSON files. The `read_file()` function is the primary method for loading these files. Your file path has to point to the location of the file so you would need to edit the below line to reflect the location of the file on your own computer.

```{python}
mad_bldgs = gpd.read_file('../data/madrid_buildings/madrid_bldgs.gpkg')

mad_bldgs.head()
```

The `head()` method shows the first few rows of the GeoDataFrame, including the geometry column. The CRS is automatically detected and set.

### Plotting

Let's plot the data.

```{python}
mad_bldgs.plot()
```

To zoom in when plotting you can set your x and y axis limits. For a cleaner plot, it is also generally preferable to turn off the axes so that the coordinates don't render.

```{python}
ax = mad_bldgs.plot()

ax.set_xlim(439000, 442000)
ax.set_ylim(4473000, 4476000)
ax.axis('off')
```

Let's create a new column called `area` which we will set to the value of each geometry's area, then we will plot the data once more, this time rendering the colour by the area of the building.

```{python}
mad_bldgs['area'] = mad_bldgs.geometry.area

ax = mad_bldgs.plot(
    column='area',
    cmap='viridis',
    vmax=10000,
)

ax.set_xlim(439000, 442000)
ax.set_ylim(4473000, 4476000)
ax.axis('off')
```

### Saving Data

GeoPandas can save GeoDataFrames to various formats, including Shapefiles, GeoPackages, and GeoJSON files. The `to_file()` method is used for this purpose. You can specify the format using the `driver` parameter.

```python
mad_bldgs.to_file('bldgs_w_area.gpkg', driver='GPKG')
```
