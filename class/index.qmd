This section provides some introductory examples on the usage of Python and computational notebooks. These are high-level examples to give a basic indication of how these tools might typically be used; for more detailed examples, please refer to the online documentation for the libraries used.

1. [Notebooks](1_notebooks.qmd): Learn what computational notebooks are and how to use them.
2. [Python Basics](2_basics.qmd): Python basics, including variables, data types, and simple operations.
3. [Spatial Data](3_spatial.qmd): Spatial data types and basic operations using the `shapely` package.
4. [GeoPandas](4_geopandas.qmd): Use of the `geopandas` package for handling geospatial datasets.
5. [OSM Data & Urban Morphology](5_ecosystem.qmd): Download OSM data with `osmnx` and use the `momepy` library to explore urban morphology.
6. [Cityseer](6_cityseer.qmd): Use `cityseer` to calculate network centralities and landuse accessibilities.
7. [Exploratory Data Science](7_data_science.ipynb): Use `seaborn` plotting library for exploratory data science.
8. [Modeling & ML](8_models.ipynb): A very brief introduction to data modelling techniques.
